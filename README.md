# Serex

A hobby OS. Sort of following along with Philipp Oppermann's Rust tutorials to start out, but with lots of twists.

Features:

* A Unicode-capable framebuffer terminal that can display scripts that don't require complex rendering (RTL, combining diacritics)
* A VGA text mode terminal that transparently displays Unicode text in CP437 if it can be represented
